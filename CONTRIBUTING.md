# Contributing to Konvert

Thanks for your interest in contributing!
I appreciate any help to improve the library, whether it's fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or enhancing tests.

## How to Contribute

> ℹ️ For larger changes, please open an issue or discussion first to discuss the proposed feature.

Open a PR from your forked repository to the `main` branch.
Summarize changes briefly in the PR title, elaborate in the description,
and reference related issues or discussions there.

* Keep PRs small and focused.
* All code must compile and pass tests (checked automatically via GitHub Actions).
* Include new tests for new features or bug fixes.
* Follow existing code style and conventions.
* Update documentation as needed.
* Avoid breaking changes without discussion.
* Follow Conventional Commits for messages.

If you can, include a minimal code example that demonstrates the issue.

## Feature Requests?

If you have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue or discussion and
describe it. Give context and define the use case and any further relevant details.
